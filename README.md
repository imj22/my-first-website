#My Personal Website

layout goals (first look): 

for navigation
- format similarly to carrd buttons, in which there is a black border around each individual nav links. 
- potentially create an event, so that when the mouse hovers over the black-bordered boxes that box will fill with black and the text will turn white? 
    --> to do this, i might have to change from using nav, and instead use a list? or table ??? or other text element that i format in css to be horizontal , and add in a reference??? or source/link???????? to link it to the various sections, since aeshtetically the navigation elements are blue and classically link-like. css style change for text does not work on them.
-so far, i have navigation elements(?) for bio, interests, and a picture of a fox.
-create a nav element for future projects? maybe upload pictures of art inbetween (for fun, and to make it look aesthetically pleasing ^^)

for sections: 
- figure out how to separate sections, so that there is a "home" page and the user will have to use the navigation tab to get elsewhere. maybe i can put my art in the homepage to make it look pleasing/engaging?
