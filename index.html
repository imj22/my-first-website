                <p>My name is Bella Johansson. I am a 21 year-old Swedish-American university student studying economics, diplomacy, and game theory at New York University. </p>
                <p>Prior to my time as a university student I spent most of my life I training as a professional-level alpine ski racer. Alpine ski racing is a dangerous, high-intensity sport that is enacted in physically extreme and unpredictable enviornments, and my time racing and training as a high-level alpine ski racer definitively shaped my world view and the manner in which I interact with work. </p></p>

                    <p>I am a very creatively-oriented individual and enjoy writing and analyzing the outside world. I have a deep love for music, art, and studying the tools with which we use to percieve reality, make decisions, and interact with one another.</p>
